# 👋 Hi, I'm Anton Smirnov

**Computational Linguist • NLP Engineer • Corpus Architect**  
_Based in Berlin, working at the intersection of language, data, and meaning._

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Master's student at Freie Universität Berlin in *Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East*, focusing on **computational linguistics**, **historical corpora**, and **vector-based language analysis**.  
My work centers on processing Arabic, Persian, and Chinese texts using NLP pipelines, OCR, embeddings, and dimensionality reduction for **semantic retrieval**, **cluster analysis**, and **language change modeling**.

I build tools that:
- Extract structure from messy historical data
- Compress and visualize high-dimensional meaning spaces
- Enable interactive search in classical texts

## 🔧 Projects

### 🕌 [al-Bukhari-Hadith-RAG](https://github.com/Quchluk/al-Bukhari-Hadith-RAG)
_RAG pipeline for classical Islamic texts_  
→ Embedding-based retrieval over Hadiths with citation tracing and Streamlit interface.

### 📉 [JLProj](https://github.com/Quchluk/jlproj)
_Johnson–Lindenstrauss Projection Toolkit_  
→ Efficient dimensionality reduction with CLI and FAISS search. Ideal for large NLP embeddings.

### 📚 Corpus Work
- Normalized and vectorized 250M+ token Persian corpus for OCR research
- Temporal clustering of Arabic texts using PCA, TDA, and semantic topology
- TF-ADF lexical change analysis on OpenIslamicate corpus
