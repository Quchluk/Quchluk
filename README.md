## Profile

Master’s student at Freie Universität Berlin in *Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East*, specializing in **computational linguistics**, **historical corpora**, and **vector-based language analysis**.  
Focus areas include the processing of Arabic, Persian, and Chinese texts through NLP pipelines, OCR, embeddings, and dimensionality reduction for **semantic retrieval**, **cluster analysis**, and **language change modeling**.

I design tools that:
- Extract structure from large, unstructured textual data  
- Visualize and interpret high-dimensional semantic spaces  
- Enable efficient retrieval and analysis of classical texts

## Selected Projects

### [al-Bukhari-Hadith-RAG](https://github.com/Quchluk/al-Bukhari-Hadith-RAG)
Retrieval-augmented generation pipeline for classical Islamic texts.  
Implements embedding-based search with citation tracing and a Streamlit interface.

### [JLProj](https://github.com/Quchluk/jlproj)
Johnson–Lindenstrauss Projection Toolkit.  
Provides efficient dimensionality reduction with CLI utilities and FAISS integration for large-scale NLP embeddings.

### Corpus Development
- Normalized and vectorized a 250M+ token Persian corpus for OCR research  
- Conducted temporal clustering of Arabic texts using PCA, TDA, and semantic topology  
- Applied TF–ADF lexical change analysis to the OpenIslamicate corpus
